A free silent (hidden) native cryptocurrency miner capable of mining ETC, RVN, XMR, RTM and much more, with many features suited for mining silently.

SilentCryptoMiner v3.4.1 - Miner for ETC, RVN, XMR, RTM & many more

A free silent (hidden) native cryptocurrency miner capable of mining ETC, RVN, XMR, RTM and much more, with many features suited for mining silently.

This miner can mine all the following algorithms and thus any cryptocurrency that uses one of them

Main Features
- Native C++ - Miner installer/injector and watchdog coded fully in C++ with no run requirements except a 64-bit OS
- Injection (Silent/Hidden) - Hide miner inside another process like explorer.exe, conhost.exe, svchost.exe and others
- Idle Mining - Can be configured to mine at different CPU and GPU usages or not at all while computer is or isn't in use
- Stealth - Pauses the miner and clears the GPU memory and RAM while any of the programs in the "Stealth Targets" option are open
- Watchdog - Monitors the miner file, miner processes and startup entry and restores the miner if anything is removed or killed
- Multiple Miners - Can create multiple miners to run at the same time, for example one XMR (CPU) miner and one RVN (GPU) miner
- CPU & GPU Mining - Can mine on Both CPU and GPU (Nvidia & AMD)
- Windows Defender Exclusions - Can add exclusions into Windows Defender after being started to avoid being detected
- Process Killer - Constantly checks for any programs in the "Kill Targets" list and kills them if found
- Remote Configuration - Can get the miner settings remotely from a specified URL every 100 minutes
- Web Panel Support - Has support for monitoring and configuring all the miners efficiently in a free self-hosted online web panel
- Rootkit - Has a built-in rootkit that can be enabled to fully hide the miner processes
- And many many more.

Wiki
You can find the wiki here or at the top of the page. The wiki contains information about the miner and all of its features, it also has some answers to frequently asked questions.

Web Panel
You can find the web panel that the miner officially supports here: UnamWebPanel. The web panel can be used to monitor your miners hashrate, status, connection settings and more. It can also be used to change the miner settings just like how the option "Remote Configuration" does it.

Changelog
3.3.1 (04/09/2023)
Added OpenCL ICD loader statically into the GPU miner because some systems local loaders do not seem to work
Added automatic CPU mining core restart when a prolonged period of zero hashrate is detected
Fixed administrator "Startup" trigger to be "on login" when "Run as System" is disabled
Reduced some antivirus detections by modifying the miner compilation command
Changed some miner builder compiler commands to be absolute instead of relative
Added "Assembly" tab "Version" number sanitization
Fixed unnecessary log warning during compilation
Removed many old unused debug strings inside the miners
3.3.0 (24/08/2023)
Added the KawPow (kawpow) algorithm directly into the GPU miner
Added new FiroPow (firopow) algorithm
Added new ProgPow (progpow) algorithm
Added new ProgPowZ (progpowz) algorithm
Added new EvrProgPow (evrprogpow) algorithm
Implemented KawPow, FiroPow, EvrProgPow, ProgPow and ProgPowZ using only OpenCL for both Nvidia and AMD to bypass large CUDA NVRTC library requirement
Rewrote most of the GPU miner to add support for multiple algorithm families and to greatly improve stability and reliability
Added Sero-Proxy protocol to be able to mine Sero (ProgPow)
Removed KawPow (kawpow) algorithm from the XMR miner and also the large CUDA NVRTC library to make sure no one accidentally uses it
Re-added the Panthera (rx/xla) algorithm
Added Zephyr coin (rx/0) solo mining support
Moved the XMR miner "GPU Mining" option into the "Advanced" tab to discourage unprofitable XMR GPU mining
Moved the "Use Rootkit" option into the "Advanced Options" for better clarity regarding its complexity
Changed Task Scheduler Task creation from Powershell to only using the command line with a temporary XML file
Changed MSR driver path from using a static library path to a dynamically generated path
Modified embedded file encryption and decryption to reduce heuristic detections
Changed the code compiler build to different one to greatly reduce the compiler-caused antivirus detections
Improved the external compiler execution commands by better forcing absolute paths in commands
Added a mutex into the miner installer/injector to make it checkable by the watchdog
Reduced the watchdog checking interval for better persistance
Removed unused helper functions
Rewrote uninstallers miner killer function to work with Process IDs above the ushort limit
Changed unicode string initialization from a macro to a function to reduce the final code size
Changed string formatting from using the built-in Windows API to instead use a much smaller custom function
Moved web panel reporting to happen before CPU idle usage change in order to help make the hashrate look less confusing
Improved RandomX database regeneration speed when leaving "Stealth" on pools with infrequent new jobs
Fixed weird default "Stealth on Fullscreen" configuration value when "Run as System" was disabled
Fixed possible null terminator string length counting problem inside the GPU checking function
Reduced unnecessary recursive directory creation function stack size
Changed miners execution state to no longer always semi-block sleep mode on some computers
Restructured the algorithm selection list to be easier to use
Added semi-CLI functionality for building miners through the command line
Updated the rootkit to a new version
3.2.0 (01/04/2023)
Changed miner settings from being passed through the command line to instead be passed directly through the PEB
Changed XMR miner to clear RAM during "Stealth" when possible
Changed PEB calls to be more obfuscated due to new detections
Changed miner to read the current executable path for installation directly from the PEB instead of a Windows API call
Changed miner and watchdog to read the environmental variables directly by traversing the PEB
Included rootkit directly inside the miner instead of using the rootkit installer to avoid the new AMSI detections and for more flexibility
Changed rootkit to now run outside of the "Startup" installation flow to allow for it to run when "Startup" is disabled
Moved "Install Rootkit" out from "Advanced Options" and renamed it to "Use Rootkit (Hide Miner)" since the rootkit should now be stable
Updated compiler command options to reduce detections
Added system call registry access functions to allow registry manipulation without using the Windows API or CMD
Changed GPU checking to directly read the registry instead of using a WMI command with a file buffer
Added signature cloning tab where you can clone the digital certificate of another program into the miner
Moved administrator checks from powershell directly into the C++ code
Added Task Scheduler "Startup" entry checking into the Watchdog
Merged obfuscate.h library and obfuscatew.h library into a custom-made unified version called obfuscateu.h
Added a custom-made SysWhispersU direct system call generator and removed the previous SysWhispers2
Modified SysWhispersU and obfuscateu.h to use different encryptions in order to avoid XOR detections
Added simple obfuscation to well-known SysWhispers constants and offsets to avoid static detections
Readded explorer.exe as injection option
Made explorer.exe the default injection option again
Updated uninstaller to instead find the watchdog and miner processes by enumerating system mutex handles to find the owner process
Added "Disable Windows Update" rollback into the uninstaller to allow the uninstaller to fix Windows Update during uninstallation
Updated checker to instead check if the mutex is active to ascertain whether the miner and watchdog is running or not
Merged many C++ files together to be able to store them unzipped in the project in order to make all code changes directly visible in commits
Optimized and shortened many functions such as the previously verbose process creation function
Increased delete pending injection temporary file name length to further decrease collision chance
Fixed possible parent spoofing failure if required buffer size changes between system calls
Change installation to call reg.exe and schtasks.exe directly when possible instead of through cmd.exe
Fixed "Startup" installation bug on some systems when "Entry Name" contained a space
Fixed support for Unicode characters inside the "Assembly" settings
Updated both miners
